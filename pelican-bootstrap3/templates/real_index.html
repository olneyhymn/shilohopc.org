                <h2>Our Worship</h2>
                <p>We seek to worship according to God’s word. Our worship service is what most people would call “traditional.” We don’t believe that makes it any less joyful or vibrant. We love worshipping God together. We sing hymns and psalms, we pray, and we listen to God’s word. In other words, we try to do what Christians have done for 2000 years.</p>

                <h2>Our Children</h2>
                <p>We believe that children are a blessing from the Lord! We provide a clean, welcoming nursery for any children age two and under.</p>
                <p>We also encourage children to attend the worship service with their parents.</p>
                <p>Every Sunday evening at 4:45 various families in the church teach Candychism. Children memorize the Children’s Catechism and receive candy at the end!</p>

  <div class="panel-heading"><big>Candychism</big>
  </div>
  <div class="panel-body">
    During the Prayer Meeting younger children may attend “Candychism” where they are taught from either the First Catechism or the Westminster Shorter catechism. This is a very fun time for the children during which they are taught the doctrines of the faith and enjoy learning and reciting the answer to the catechism question of the week with their friends!
